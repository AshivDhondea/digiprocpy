# Digital Signal/Image/Data Processing in Python

## Radar systems

## Target tracking
We implemented several target tracking methods of the Gauss-Newton class based on [1]. Routines for dynamic target simulation are also provided.

## Numerical integration
We have routines for integrating deterministic and stochastic differential equations. For deterministic numerical integration, we implemented the common 4th order Runge-Kutta method and the basic Euler integration method.
